URL Shortener API
=========================

A very simple app that shortens urls.

Fulfills the following user stories:

- I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.

- If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.

- When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.

Built using: MongoDB, NodeJS, Bootstrap v4
